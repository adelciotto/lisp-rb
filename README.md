# lisp-rb

![preview](preview.png)

A short and incomplete Lisp repl written in the ruby programming
language. Only a small custom subset of a typical Lisp has been implemented.
This is simply a learning experience for myself to gain more insight into both
the lisp and ruby programming languages.

It has the following features so far.

* `If-else` statements.
* Variable and function definition via `defvar` and `defun`.
* Variable and function mutation by `setf`.
* Lamba expressions via `lambda`.
* `Let` and `flet` statements for lexical scoping.
* Basic error handling.
* Scoped variables.
